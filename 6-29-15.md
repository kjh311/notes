DOM elements can be nested inside each other. And somehow, the handler of the parent works even if you click on it's child. The reason is event bubbling.

`event.bubbles`

`li { cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; }` to change the cursor into a pointer

`cursor: url(images/my-cursor.png), auto;` to change cursor into an image

`board.onclick = function (event) {
console.log(event);
}` logs what happens when that function runs

###Git and Github
- Explain difference of Git vs. Github. Git is local version control system. Github is an online repository.

- Branching: creating another copy of a file/repo on github that allows for different version.  Better to branch than to constaintly overwrite the master branch.  

- Explain Version Control: allows new file changes without overwriting original.

-DVCS Distributed Version Control System.

- Impliment Git Flow (init, add, commit, push)

- Package Managers: allow you to install programs through Git quickly.  `brew install git`

- `git rm --cache README.md` removes a file from git being tracked.

Commit often to avoid files being lost. Use the `git log`
`commit d1b1f10a2aa8268ace4a6db589b3c5b1a92853ab` to find that specific file again.

Be detailed with commit messages so you can tell which file is which.  

`echo "Hello World" >>index.html` adds words to the file.

`git reset --hard d1b1f10a2aa8268ace4a6db589b3c5b1a92853ab` will reset that file back to that version.  Can't be undone, can't get to a version after that version.

after creating a new repo on github, enter the code `git remote add origin git@github.com:kjh311/git_flow.git` to link online and local repos. 

`git push -u origin master` `-u` means upstream

##JS Parts
####Data Types:
- Variables: point to or reference data.  
- Objects
- Events
- Arrays

- functions: like a recipe, follows steps.  

- Keywords: built in part of the language that allows us to do something.
- Undefined
- For loops
- if/ else
- while loops
- Switch statements
- - Operators

Primitives:
- boolean
- Strings
- Numbers

#Lesson Objectives

- Write a function that takes parameters and returns a value
- clearly differentiate between when to use console.log and when to use return
- explain what var does
- explain what creates a new "scope" in JS
- Define "SCOPE": Describes what we can see, what we have access to.  At THIS MOMENT what can I see? May change


- functions need inputs and output.  only 1 output and ALWAYS needs an output.

??Pointing vs referecing

Function Hoisting: When you use 
`console.log(name());`
`function name() {}`
instead of `var name = function();` the computer will not return an error if you call the function before naming it.


Local scope: a function's own scope.  when you have a local variable it can reference global and local, but global can't reference local.

Global Scope: when you have access to all variables.  

`window` when typed into the console is the global variable

if you forget to put `var` before a variable in the local scope, it becomes global.
