# More CSS stuff

CSS Box Model: Almost all elements on a page are boxes.
Padding: the space from the box to the Border.
Margin: Distance outside of the Border.

If you declare border and padding but not width, the box will push inwards.  

If you don’t declare width it will take up the width of the parent element.

Background color affects box and padding.

Put self closing tags on self closing tags to let you know

CMND + 1/2 in sublime to switch tabs

Inline Positioning:  Elements stay horizontally next to each other. INGs are naturally inline.  Don’t get affected by margin top or bottom.  
`Text-Align: Center;` to center

Block Positioning:  Line breaks between elements, vertically.
`Margin: 0 auto;` to center

CMD + / to comment out in sublime

Margin: 10 20, 10 is top and bottom and 20 is left and right

Margin: 10 20 30 40, top right bottom left

Static: default, no line breaks 

`Float: left;` good for making columns.  Multiple floats go inline, but if it reaches the edge of the screen it line breaks.  GOOD FOR RESPONSIVE DESIGN!!!!!!

- Bring inflated cushion

`Position: Relative;`  moves element relative to its original position

`Position: Absolute;`takes element out of flow of document, and you can dictate exactly where it goes.  

Position: Fixed;

#JAVASCRIPT

Used in every browser. Doesn’t use CLASSES, but will in the next version.

Node.js  allows javascript to be run on the server.  

Compiled Language: runs faster.  Javascript is not compiled.

###Javascript has 6 data types:  

- Undefined: Doesn't hold a value

- Null:  Variable that doesn't have a value(empty) Name it null on purpose
`var name = null;`

- String

- Number

- Boolean

- Object: collection of properties. 0 or more.  Properties consist of KEY-VALUE PAIRS.<br />
`var o = {name: "Jim",
age: 34
}`

Mozilla Developer Network (MDM) good source of info for operators(<,>,)

- http://docs.emmet.io/ helps when writting html and css

- `Array.length()`: gives length of array

- `Array.push()`: adds element to array

- `Array.pop()`: removes last element in array.

- `Array.reverse()`: reverses order of elements in array. Modifies the array.

- `Array.shift()`: removes first element, and returns removed value.

- `Array.unshift()`:Adds new items to begining of array.

- `Array.sort()`: if array is strings, returns in alphabetical, numbered array returns how it was.

- `Array.concat()`: multiple arrays in one array get combined into one array.  Does NOT modify the original

- `Array.indexOf()`: returns position desired

- `Array.lastIndexOf()`: like indexof but starts at the end and works backwards.

- `Array.join()`: joins elements of array into a string. NOT modify.
`a.join(", ")` adds a comma and space between them

- `Array.slice(1,3)`: returns just those elements

- `Array.splice(1, 2, ["trojan")`: 1st number is starting point, 2nd is number of elements to be removed, 3rd is what to replace it with.  

- `array.sort().reverse()`  is a CHAINING method.

METHOD: when a key = a function

OBJECT LITERAL
`var house = {`
    `bedrooms: 4,`
   ` baths: 3,`
    `color: 'purple'
};` 

house.baths: DOT NOTATION, Var.Key

house["baths"]: LITERAL NOTATION, needs quotes

OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION
`function House(numBaths, numBedrooms, color) {
    this.baths = numBaths;
    this.bedrooms = numBedrooms;
    this.color = color;
}` //numBaths is named different from baths so as not to confuse that they are the same

`var house = new House(3, 4, 'purple');`  This creates new object each time it's run
