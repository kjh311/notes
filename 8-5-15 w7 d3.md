##Debugging Node
SWBAT:
- Use Morgan for Logging
- Use Nodemon to avoid auto-restart
- use node-inspector to debug.

https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DTLA_4/blob/master/work/w07/d03/instructor/debugging-and-logging-in-node-lesson.md

` express -e node_app` scaffolding, but not frowned upon for using it.  :)

`npm install`

Morgan shows us the server-side errors and the console is used for client-side errors. 

`node-inspector` in one terminal

`nodemon --debug ./bin/www` in another


##Intro to NoSql with MongoDB
- Understand History of Mongo DB
- Describe Key Features
- Explain the difference between Embedding and referencing
- Issue basic CRUD commands from Mongo Shell

Mongo is built for speed, and to be able to scale up.

`mongod` in one terminal and `mongo` in another to open the console.

`show dbs` displays databases

`db` says which db we are using

`use myDB` switches to that db

`db.people.insert({name: "Matt Damon", age: 55})`

`db.people.find()`

`db.people.find({name: "Kevin Huelsmann"})`

`db.people.insert([{name: "Phil Howley", fun: true}, {name: "Sam Claney", married: true}, {name: "Jaytee", hat: true, shoes: "expensive"}])`

` db.people.find({age: {$gt: 20}})` greather than.  

`db.people.find({age: {$lt: 20}})` less than.

`db.people.find({age: {$gt: 20}}).sort({name: 1})` sorts results alphabetically.

`db.people.update({name: "Jack Sparrow"}, {$set: {age: 99}})` to update

`db.people.update({name: "Stanley"}, {$inc: {age: 10}}, {multi: true})` updates multiple Stanleys and increments their age by 10.

`db.people.update({name: "Stanley"}, {$inc: {age: -15}}, {multi: true})` negative number decrements age.

`db.people.remove({name: "Stanley"}, {multi: true})` to delete all Stanleys.

BSON: Binary Json.

###Embedding and Referencing

Embedding is putting another object within an object.  Fast, and generally want to embed, unless the 2nd object is too large.  

Referencing is using an id number to link to the 2nd object.
