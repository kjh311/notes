##Learning Objectives

- Descrive the Git "Flow" model that you use to organize code and collaborate as a team.

- Use branches to isolate changes tied to specific feaures or architectures. 

- Efficiently and correctly resolve merge conflicts.


##MEAN STACK

- Node: JS on server side

- Express: Sinatra like framework, work your own routes, very minimal.

- MongoDB: We use Mongoose to help structure the DB.

- Angular: Won't use until project week.

- JSON: used to speek to server and client, asynchronous.  

- We will use JQuery on the front end and AJAX.

###Create Repo Wrkflow
1) Id master and upstream repo
2) "Fork" upstream as origin
3) cloned origin to local

###Working Workflow
1) Make some change
2) Add or stage the work
3) Commit / save the work

###Collaboration Workflow
1) Create Repo workflow
2) Pull from Upstream
3) Resolve Merge Conflicts
4) Working Workflow
5) Push to Origin 

- Good article: http://git-scm.com/blog

Pull Request: when you want to add changes to the upstream repo.

Important to Fork and then Clone, in order to use Github's Pull Requert System.  

Branching learning game: http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/

- `git remote add origin ssh` 

Branch and merge:
`git branch iss53` creates branch
`git checkout iss53` goes to that branch.
1) `git checkout -b (feature_name)` creates branch and goes to that branch
2) make changes
3) `git add, git commit`
4) `git checkout master`
5) `git diff`  
6) `git merge (feature_name)`
7 `git branch -v` sees how many branches you have
8) `git push origin (branch name)` to push to origin with a branch on github.  

You can upload to a branch repo, then pull request to have it merged with the master. 

If a remote repo has a branch on it, other poeple can push and pull on the branch, but not the main.
