###Object Oriented Ruby

- Understand everything in Ruby is an object
- `CMMD + B` lets Ruby run the code
- Create Classes
- Use Inheritance
- Apply Setters and Getters

Basic Object: everything inherits from BO's >>
Objects >>
String // Integers // Array // Hash

##Objects
can have:
- attributes / properties
- behaviors / methods

##Lesson Objectives
- Use pry to explore objects

(In Pry)
`ls (object)` will tell you the available methods.
`_` return value of last expression
