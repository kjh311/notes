#Ruby - Data Types / Vars & Methods

##Lesson Objectives:

1) Identify Ruby Data Types

2) Define and Call a Method

3) Use Variable naming to control Scope.

A real web app usually communicates with a web server.  Ruby is very useful on the server.  Runs in the terminal not in the browser.  General programming languange.

Sinatra or Ruby on Rails are frameworks. 

A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Pure object oriented, everything is an object.  

Type "IRB" into the terminal to start. 

###Data Types
- JS data types: Objects (arrays and functions), Booleans, number, strings, undefined, null.

- Ruby Data Types:
###Booleans.  
0 is true in RB. In Ruby, only things that are false are FALSE and NIL.  

### Numbers: 
Ruby distinguishes between floats and integers.  
- Since everything in RB is an object, we can find out what class was used to create is by calling it's `.class` method.
- Itegers are either instances of the `Fixum` or `Bignum` class.

- Floating Point Numbers
- There's only one class used to create floats. `(2.34).class`

###Strings: 
`"Hello.methods"` to see available methods. 
- Use Double Quotes for string Interpolation.  

###Objects: 
- everything in RB is an object.
- All objects have a class from which they were created.


###Arrays:
- Just like in JS they can be created using an array literal and indexed with bracket notation.  

`my_array = ['Hello', 'World']`

###Null and Undefined. 
- The equivalent of JS null and nil.
- There are no `undefined` in RB. If you access a variable that has not been initialized you will receive an error. 

###Methods:

###Variable Scope
In RB the way we name our variables determine Scope.

- Global [$] should be avoided
 
- Local [a-z]
 
- Instance: [@] a scope inside an instance of a class. Great for sharing information between all methods within a class. The lifetime of an instance variable remains for as long as the instance itself is in existance. Most common type we will use. 

- Class [@@] Live outside of the class and are in scope to all instances of that same class.  There is only one copy of a class of a particular type, therefore there is only one copy of a class available.

- A constant (global) [A-Z] 

##Ruby Control Flow
SWBAT
- Explain Ruby Conditionals
- Utilize Loops in Ruby
- Define and Call methods

`1.upto(3) do |num|
puts "#{num}. going"
end
puts "gone"`

`3.downto(1) do |guess|
puts "You have #{guess} guesses left"
end`

`for i in 0..3
puts "The value of the variable is #{i}"
end`

`count = 10
loop do
	break if count < 1
	puts "Looping"
	count -= 1
end`

##HASH
- use when order doesn't matter
- key / value pairs
- use when you have more complex collection of data

`hash_with_value = {:name => Stanley"}`

`new_hash = {name: "Stanley"}`

`person = {:name => "Tony Stark", :age => 35, :titles => ["Genius", "Billionaire", "Playboy", "Philanthropist"]}`

` person[:name]` "Tony Stark"

`person[:titles][0]` "Genius"

`person[:age] = person[:age] + 1` 36

`person[:alias] = "Ironman"`

`person.delete(:alias)`

`person.keys`

`person.values`

`person.keys.include?(:name)`

`person.values.include?(36)`

`users = [
	{user: "Keyan", role: "Insructor"},
	{user: "Larry", role: "Instructor"}]`
	
`ga_markets = ["NYC", "LA", "SYD", "LND"]`

iterate over hash
`ga_markets.each {|market| puts market}`
