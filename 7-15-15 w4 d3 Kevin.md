##Model
- Relational Databases
- SQL
- Model Data
- Active Record

##Lesson Objectives
- Define the relationship between:
- - Entities / Tables
- - Attributes / columns
- - members / rows

- Draw ERDs using crow's foot notation
- Describe how tables use foreign keys
- Explain the different relationships: 
- - 1 :1
- - 1 :n
- - n: n

`Relational Databases` RDB you can access the data in a different format than it was stored. 

"Reading" means getting info from DB.
"Writing" means storing.

####Creating info for DB
- Creating / Inserting: common way to write data to DB

- Update info

- Delete Info

SQL : is the language to write / read data. A Domain Specific Language (DSL) for cruding a RDB.
"Reading" is called "Select". Create is called "Insert".  Update is called "Update". Delete is "Delete". Language we use to talk to RDB is SQL.

HTTP: A DSL for cruding data over the internet. Reading is called "Get". Create is called "Post".  Update is "Put / Patch". Delete is "Delete".   Data coming in from RACK is HTTP.

Web Developers live in the world between SQL and HTTP.  Logic happens in controller.  

`CRUD` : CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE

Relational Database Management System RDBMS is to a DB the way an OS is to a file.  "Postgres" / "PostgreSQL" is our RDBMS.  Postgres will talk to your DBs for you.  

####Alternatives to Postgres

- MySQL & Maria DB: OpenSource. 

- mSQL & ExpressSQL & mSQL & Server & Oracle & Access DB: owned by Microsoft. Mid level.

- Oracle: High level enterprise

"NoSQL" are databases that don't use SQL. 

- Key / Value Store: Redis, CouchDB, memcached

- Page or Document: Mongo DB (Drop in and take out, easy, but no structure.)

- Map / Graph

- Hadoop

###Relational Data:
Data structured in the format of:

- `entities`: classes / groups. Most often represented as a table. Columns are attributes, rows are the members.  

- `atributes`: qualities

- `members`: actual instances or real things

- `relationships`: A relationship in a relational data sense, is defined between entities, not members, or tables, different classes (people and dogs).  Every relationship describes how 1 entity relates to another.  Every relationship has a number or quanitity embeded in it, those quantities are:

- - `1:1`: one to one.  Rare. 
- - `1:n`: one to many. 1. Belongs-to. 2. Has-many.
- - `n:n`: many to many, has-and-belongs-to-many. HABTM


Derived from "Set Theory" that deals with classifying things into groups. Classify based on its qualities into a group.  

The mathmatical notation of set theory is called "relational algebra". 

####ERD
Entity Relationship Diagram: a diagram with Entity, list of attributes inside, and it's relationship/s (with a 1 for one relationship, and crows feet for many).

Information Architecture: 

`psql` in terminal to start SQL: a default bare bones postgres.  

`CREATE DATABASE wdi;` to create database.

`\c wdi` to cd into database.

`\l` to list databases

`\q` to quit

`\d` to say what's in it.

`\d table name` to display that table


to create table:
`wdi=# CREATE TABLE instructors (`
`wdi(# id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,`
`wdi(# name TEXT NOT NULL,`
`wdi(# experience INT NOT NULL,`
`wdi(# website VARCHAR(50)`
`wdi(# );`
`CREATE TABLE`

ID is 
###ALWAYS 
needed

`DROP TABLE tablename` to erase table.

`INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, "Hamilton the Dog", 3, "4 Doggy House Dr, San Bernadino, CA");` to insert data. SINGLE QUOTES NOT DOUBLE!!!!

`SELECT * FROM students;` means select all attributes from students.

`SELECT name, age FROM students ORDER BY age;` shows just name and age and orders by age.

`SELECT name, continent, region, population FROM countries WHERE region = 'Southern Europe';`
