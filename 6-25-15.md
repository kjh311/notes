### Lesson Objectives

1) Use CSS selectors that reference the DOM tree(sibling, child, ancestor) and state ("pseudo "selectors).

2) Define Proceedural Programming and compare it to other styles of programming. 

3)  Define Algorithm.

- how to open your github repo using an alias
```# open terminal
$ cd ~/.bash_profile
 add a line similar to this (name alias whatever you want - I called mine phub)
 (change the path to your wdi github repo)
$ alias phub='hub browse kingluddite/WDI_DTLA_4'
 save your .bash_profile
 refresh it with
$ source ~/.bash_profile
 type alias in terminal
$ phub
 you will be brought to your github rep!
 
- Objects hold data

- OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING just means writing a language in a way where the functionality is object oriented.  We store info in objects and we design interfaces.  Objects are full of algorithms.  

- When using CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS it's necesary to put 'new' when making a new object.  If you use METHOD it won't keep the new adjusted amount.  You have to use this.METHOD. `this.honk = function(){};`

- METHOD is a function that is the value of some property/key of an object.  Use a `;` at the end of the function syntax, but not at the end of the constructor function.  

- `function (argument) {
};`

- ALGORITHM : A process or set of rules.  A PROCESS is a list of things to do / steps that must be done in order. 

- EVENT DRIVEN PROGRAMMING : where things are happening and they trigger events, code is written to repond to those events. 

- FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING : store algorithms that tie to one another, riff off each other.  Isn't used very much.

- PROCEEDURAL PROGRAMMING : is like using IF/ELSE statements. Solves problems only using algorithms.  


##Lesson Objectives


1) Explain what a tree is in CS, and where it is used.  

- Name the parts of a tree:  
-  	Root
-  	Branch
-  Leaf
-  Ancestors / Parents
-  Descendants / Childrens
-  Siblings

- REPL: READ EVAL PRINT LOOP.  

- False things: FALSE, "", 0, undefined; NaN, null.

- True things: TRUE, numbers not 0(even negative numbers), Strings that aren't empty, 

- Only put `;` after `{}` if it's an assignment.
`var blah = function () {};`

- OR `||` returns the first truthy statement it sees.

`new Date();` gives you the time

- Tree: When data can branch off into many directions

- BRANCH: 2+ possible directions

- LEAF data can't go any further.  

- ROOT : origin of data

- Ancestor : parent or above

- Descendents : children or grandchildren elements

- Sibling:  any node with the same parent

- If / else logic is also known as branching logic.

- FOR LOOP `for (initial setup, while this part is true, do this every time)`  Used very often with ARRAYS
