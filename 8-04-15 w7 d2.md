##REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
SWBAT

- understand why we use REGEX

- Use RegExp Special Characters

- Use searching flags

- understand functions you can use

REGEX is good for searching through strings.

doc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions

http://regexr.com/

starts and ends with a `/`

the `+` in regexp means 1 or more.

`\b`code`\b` is a word boundary, so regex only looks for strings exactly matching, with no extra letters/numbers attached.

`?=` allows you to check things in a string out of order.

##Intro to NodeJS

###Objectives

- understand what Node is

- Use Node to execute JS

- Understand Modules

https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DTLA_4/blob/master/work/w07/d02/instructor/node-intro-lesson.md

Has packages / modules that extend its functionality, like Ruby uses gems.

Node is not a server.  It has performance though. 

##ExpressJS Routing
SWBAT

- require and understand node modules

- use middleware

- start NodeJS server

- Create Routing

Module = container of code.

`npm init -f` creates a package.json file.

`process.env` are environmental variables, hidden things that you want to keep safe. 

Express is simply a collection of middleware linked together.  

Middleware `function(request, response, next){
}`

Full CRUD with Express, Node, Mongo: https://www.airpair.com/javascript/complete-expressjs-nodejs-mongodb-crud-skeleton

tutorial: https://presentations.generalassemb.ly/7ee226202604b9db6cc6#/6

Steps to creating EXPRESS and NODE
1) create directory
2) cd into dirctory
3) `npm init -f`
4)`touch main.js`
5) `npm install --save body-parser express jade method-override mongoose morgan` stuff that gets installed
6) `mkdir public views`
7) `touch views/layout.jade views/index.jade`
8)put `"start": "nodemon main.js",` in the package.json


- `express-generator` is a command line tool that quickly generates a skeleton node.js app that incorporates the Express framework.
